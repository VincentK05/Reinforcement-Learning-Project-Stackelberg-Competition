# Reinforcement-Learning-Project-Stackelberg-Competition

In this respository, you may find an RL application to the Stackelberg competition model.
The Stackelberg code corresponds to the main working code, and the code.extension file corresponds to an extended application of our model. Finally the report is available under the 'report_lemarquis_kirchen' pdf file.
